This trainning camp is free and open to everyone. The goal is to provide training for the European ACM-ICPC regionals. 
The camp will last 6 days from April 9th to April 14th, 2017, and will be divided into two parts. 
  </p>
  <ul class="text-justify">
<li> Each of the first 4 days the training
will focus a particular topic (graphs, DP, geometry, ...).  It will consist of a 4h contest in the morning with problems
related to the topic, and a problem discussion in the afternoon that will go in more depth than a simple presentation of the solutions, by explaining the theory around them as well.</li>
  <li> The last 2 days will start with a 5h contest of a style similar to European ACM-ICPC regionals, and in the afternoon the solutions to the problems will be presented. The aim is to provide a good simulation of the contest conditions the teams will face in their regionals, and to see how well they succeed.</li>
  </p>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-justify">
For more details we invite you to see the <a href="schedule.html">schedule</a>.
  </p>



  <p class="text-justify">
Every day ends with an upsolving session where the teams work on the problems that remain unsolved. The coaches will be around to answer questions.
  </p>

 <p class="text-justify">
Note that there is no <a href="registration.html">registration</a> fee but each team is responsible for their accomodation and lunch (see <a href="accomodation.html">accomodation tips</a>). The coffee breaks and snacks
are provided by us.
